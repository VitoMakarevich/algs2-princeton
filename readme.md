# About

This repository contains tasks for
amazing [Alghorims course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/home/welcome)
by the great scientist [Robert Sedgewick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)).

## Structure

The structure reflects the structure, of the course, so each folder represents a week
with all classes used in the implementation.

## Build tool

I haven't included any build tool intentionally, just imported it to IDEA and
it will include `algs4j.jar` by authors and you'll be able to use my configurations.

*Important*: sorry for anything I accidentally left after myself(breakpoints, configurations, etc).
