# Peculiarities

Probably the hardest part of implementation(assuming you understand
the graph part) is mapping between graph vertex to match teams/single teams.
It's done in a set of separate methods. Also, as we manipulate numbers in the
graph, each team is mostly referred to as int(starts from 0 and uses order from
file).
